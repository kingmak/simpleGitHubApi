- try catch the os.mkdir in runExample
- document how to use in readme
- IMPORTANT: getRepoFileList doesn't give folders in the list
- IMPORTANT: need to walk above folders (need to create those folders in the requested dir n place files in em)
  <span class="css-truncate css-truncate-target"><a href="/WestleyArgentum/GitHub.jl/tree/master/test"
  file = blob, folder = tree
- files that have spaces in the name have %20, do something about dat

- DESIGN:
* Use a class
* Fix import leaks (os, urllib2 showing from simpleGitHubApi.py in the example file)
* Private and Public functions (currently to be private functions are showing)
* userName is required for every function, in the class structure make that a global private var? (so provide once)
